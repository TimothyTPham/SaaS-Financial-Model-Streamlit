# SaaS Financial Model (Streamlit App)

This project is a simple **Streamlit application** that simulates a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) financial model over a defined time horizon.

The app allows users to input assumptions such as:
- Starting customer count
- Monthly new customers
- Monthly churn rate
- ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)
- CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)
- Gross margin
- Number of forecast months

Based on these inputs, the model calculates:
- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
- Revenue and gross profit
- LTV (Customer Lifetime Value)
- CAC payback period
- Customer growth over time

The app includes:
- Interactive sidebar inputs
- Tabular output of all calculated metrics
- MRR line chart visualization
- Option to download the results as a CSV
